Using let prevents accidental redeclaration and scoping bugs. It helps make your code more predictable and clean. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-var-and-let-in-javascript/

What is the main benefit of separating JavaScript from HTML? Separating JavaScript improves code maintainability and readability. It allows HTML and JS to evolve independently.
